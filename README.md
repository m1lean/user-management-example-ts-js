# User Management Example | TS | JS

### This TypeScript file serves as an example of a basic user management system. It includes an interface "User" to define the structure of a user, a class "UserManager" for managing user data, and a function "displayUsers" to showcase user information in the console. The example usage at the end demonstrates creating a user manager instance, adding users, and displaying the list of users.
